Since iOS 18, network activity indicator is no longer displayed. iPhones with a notch or Dynamic Island 
[never displayed it](http://www.futuretap.com/blog/fix-for-the-missing-network-activity-indicator-on-iphone-x).
This framework brings it back by placing an activity indicator in the upper right of the screen on top of the
regular status bar items (on top of the clock on iPhone SE running iOS 18+).

Since a circular indicator wouldn't fit, a rectangular [KITT scanner](https://giphy.com/gifs/80s-nbc-knight-rider-Bo2WsocASVBm0)-like indicator with a gradient is shown. The indicator UI can be used standalone or as a "fix" for the iOS network activity indicator (using the existing API).

## Integration
### As a fix for the system network activity indicator

In your app delegate's `didFinishLaunching` method, **after** initializing the window, just call

    UIApplication.configureLinearNetworkActivityIndicatorIfNeeded()

Then, use the standard network activity indicator as usual.

### As a standalone view

Include a `FTLinearActivityIndicator` view in your storyboard or instantiate it from code. The class supports the following methods and properties, using a similar API as the iOS `UIActivityIndicatorView`:

- `startAnimating()`
- `stopAnimating()`
- `isAnimating: Bool`
- `hidesWhenStopped: Bool`

`tintColor` is supported to colorize the indicator gradient.

## Requirements

- iOS 12 or higher (iOS 11 is supported until version 1.6)
- compiles for Mac Catalyst or visionOS (without network activity indicator)
