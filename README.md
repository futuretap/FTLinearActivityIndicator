iPhones with a notch don't display the network activity indicator [anymore](http://www.futuretap.com/blog/fix-for-the-missing-network-activity-indicator-on-iphone-x). This framework brings it
back by placing an activity indicator in the upper right of the screen on top of the
regular status bar items on the following devices:

- iPhone X
- iPhone Xs
- iPhone Xs Max
- iPhone X Ä
- iPhone 11
- iPhone 11 Pro
- iPhone 11 Pro Max
- iPhone 12
- iPhone 12 mini
- iPhone 12 Pro
- iPhone 12 Pro Max
- iPhone 13
- iPhone 13 mini
- iPhone 13 Pro
- iPhone 13 Pro Max
- iPhone 14
- iPhone 14 Plus
- iPhone 14 Pro
- iPhone 14 Pro Max

Since a circular indicator wouldn't fit, a rectangular [KITT scanner](https://giphy.com/gifs/80s-nbc-knight-rider-Bo2WsocASVBm0)-like indicator with a gradient is shown. The indicator UI can be used standalone or as a "fix" for the iOS network activity indicator (using the existing API).

## Integration
### As a fix for the system network activity indicator

In your app delegate's `didFinishLaunching` method, **after** initializing the window, just call

    UIApplication.configureLinearNetworkActivityIndicatorIfNeeded()

Then, use the standard network activity indicator as usual.

### As a standalone view

Include a `FTLinearActivityIndicator` view in your storyboard or instantiate it from code. The class supports the following methods and properties, using a similar API as the iOS `UIActivityIndicatorView`:

- `startAnimating()`
- `stopAnimating()`
- `isAnimating: Bool`
- `hidesWhenStopped: Bool`

`tintColor` is supported to colorize the indicator gradient.

## Example

To open an example project, just call `pod try FTLinearActivityIndicator` on the command line.

## Requirements
Written in Swift 5. Should run under any iOS (obviously, the iPhone X requires iOS 11 or higher).

## Installation

FTLinearActivityIndicator is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'FTLinearActivityIndicator'
```
